# Codekite JS Boilerplate
## What is this?
This is sort of like `create-react-app`, but with much simpler
decisions that I feel can help you learn about underlying technologies.

I was bothered by using boilerplate/starter kits that I didn't
understand - due to things like obscuring underlying code by default -
so this is an attempt to create a simpler, more readable project that
hopefully both myself and others can enjoy.

## Features

- Webkit, Webkit Dev Server and HMR (Hot Module Reloading);
- Inline source maps, separate development and production Webkit
configuration files;
- PostCSS with `autoprefixer`, `css-modules`, and `cssnano`;
- A barebones React+Redux application to build from;
- Attention paid to current recommended practices;
- Simple `npm` scripts to run an `ngrok` server, start production
    builds, and more

## TODO
- [ ] Create production Webpack configuration
- [ ] Add optional Docker functionality
- [ ] Weigh and modify PostCSS steps
- [ ] Provide examples
- [ ] Integrate Redux
- [ ] Add tests
- [ ] Review best practices and modify as necessary
